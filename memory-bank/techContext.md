# Tech Context: DataCacheX

## Technologies Used

### Primary Language
- **Dart**: Cross-platform programming language optimized for client development
  - Version: Latest stable (Dart 3.x compatible)
  - Used for all library code

### Storage Technologies
1. **Hive**
   - NoSQL database for Dart and Flutter
   - Fast key-value storage with type adapters
   - Primary storage adapter

2. **SQLite**
   - Relational database engine
   - Used for structured data storage
   - Alternative adapter option

3. **SharedPreferences**
   - Simple key-value storage
   - Used for small data and settings
   - More limited but widely used in Flutter apps

4. **In-Memory Storage**
   - Volatile storage using Dart Maps
   - Used for temporary caching
   - Good for testing or short-lived data

### Dependencies
- **get_it**: Dependency injection system
- **hive_flutter**: Flutter extension for Hive
- **path_provider**: Access to file system paths
- **sqflite**: SQLite plugin for Flutter
- **shared_preferences**: Access to platform-specific persistent storage
- **crypto**: Encryption capabilities for secure storage

## Development Environment

### Required Tools
- Flutter SDK (latest stable)
- Dart SDK (latest stable)
- Suitable IDE (VS Code, Android Studio, or IntelliJ IDEA)
- Flutter and Dart plugins for chosen IDE

### Setup Process
1. Install Flutter and Dart SDKs
2. Clone the repository
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
4. Run tests with `flutter test`

## Technical Constraints

### Platform Compatibility
- Must work on all Flutter-supported platforms:
  - Android
  - iOS
  - Web
  - macOS
  - Windows
  - Linux

### Performance Requirements
- Storage operations must be asynchronous to avoid UI blocking
- Background cleanup must be efficient and low-impact
- Memory usage should be optimized, especially for mobile devices

### Security Considerations
- Optional encryption for sensitive data
- Secure handling of credentials and tokens
- No leakage of expired but sensitive data

## Testing Framework
- Unit tests for all core components
- Integration tests for adapter implementations
- Performance benchmarks for storage operations

## Build and Deployment
- Package published to pub.dev
- Semantic versioning (x.y.z) format
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Example projects demonstrating usage

## Integration Points
- Designed to integrate with any Dart or Flutter application
- Support for custom adapters to connect with other storage systems
- Compatible with existing Flutter state management solutions
