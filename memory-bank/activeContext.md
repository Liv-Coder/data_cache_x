# Active Context: DataCacheX

## Current Work Focus

The DataCacheX package is currently focused on the following areas:

1. **Core Functionality Stabilization**
   - Ensuring all basic cache operations (put, get, delete, clear) work correctly across all adapters
   - Fixing any identified bugs in the main API
   - Improving error handling and recovery mechanisms

2. **Adapter Optimizations**
   - Enhancing performance of the Hive adapter for large datasets
   - Optimizing SQLite adapter query patterns
   - Improving SharedPreferences adapter for complex type handling

3. **Background Cleanup Enhancement**
   - Making the background cleanup process more configurable
   - Reducing its impact on application performance
   - Adding options for manual cleanup triggers

## Recent Changes

Recent development has focused on:

1. **Type Safety Improvements**
   - Enhanced type checking during put/get operations
   - Better error messages for type mismatches
   - Additional type adapter registrations for common Flutter types

2. **Documentation Enhancements**
   - More comprehensive README with usage examples
   - Better API documentation with examples for each method
   - Updated CHANGELOG with recent changes

3. **Service Locator Refactoring**
   - Simplified the setup process
   - Added more configuration options
   - Improved adapter registration process

## Next Steps

The following tasks are planned for upcoming development:

1. **Performance Testing**
   - Develop comprehensive benchmarks for different adapters
   - Compare performance across various operation types
   - Identify and address bottlenecks

2. **Additional Adapters**
   - Add support for Isar database
   - Create a network-based adapter for distributed caching
   - Develop a file-based adapter for larger objects

3. **API Enhancements**
   - Add batch operations (putAll, getAll)
   - Implement cache statistics and monitoring
   - Add support for cache invalidation patterns

4. **Platform-Specific Optimizations**
   - Optimize web platform storage with IndexedDB
   - Enhance mobile adapters for battery efficiency
   - Improve desktop storage with larger capacity handling

## Active Decisions and Considerations

Currently evaluating:

1. **Encryption Strategy**
   - Whether to use built-in Hive encryption or a custom solution
   - How to handle encryption keys securely
   - Performance impact of encryption on different adapters

2. **Serialization Improvements**
   - Whether to support additional serialization formats beyond JSON
   - How to optimize serialization for large objects
   - Ways to handle circular references in complex objects

3. **Versioning and Migration**
   - How to handle schema changes in stored objects
   - Whether to add automatic migration support
   - Best practices for versioning cached data

4. **Plugin Architecture**
   - Whether to implement a plugin system for extensions
   - How to structure the plugin API
   - What kinds of plugins would be most valuable
