# Progress: DataCacheX

## What Works

### Core API
- ✅ Basic cache operations (put, get, delete, clear)
- ✅ Type-safe storage and retrieval
- ✅ Expiry-based caching
- ✅ Cache item verification
- ✅ Key existence checking

### Adapters
- ✅ Hive adapter with full functionality
- ✅ Memory adapter with full functionality
- ✅ SQLite adapter with basic functionality
- ✅ SharedPreferences adapter with basic functionality

### Service Locator
- ✅ Dependency injection setup
- ✅ Adapter registration
- ✅ Serializer registration
- ✅ Custom type support

### Serialization

- ✅ List and Map serialization
- ✅ JSON serialization for complex types
- ✅ Custom serializer registration

### Background Processing
- ✅ Basic background cleanup functionality
- ✅ Configurable cleanup frequency
- ✅ Cleanup initialization

### Documentation
- ✅ README with basic usage examples
- ✅ API documentation for primary classes
- ✅ CHANGELOG maintenance

## Known Issues

### High Priority
1. **Type Safety Gaps**: Some complex nested types may not properly maintain type information when retrieved from cache.
   - **Status**: Under investigation
   - **Affected**: All adapters

2. **Background Cleanup Performance**: Background cleanup can cause performance hiccups on very large caches.
   - **Status**: Performance optimization planned
   - **Affected**: All adapters, especially Hive and SQLite

### Medium Priority
1. **Large Object Serialization**: Very large objects can cause performance issues during serialization.
   - **Status**: Investigating chunking strategies
   - **Affected**: All adapters

2. **Web Compatibility**: Some features have reduced functionality in web platform.
   - **Status**: Needs platform-specific implementation
   - **Affected**: Primarily Hive adapter on web

### Low Priority
1. **Documentation Gaps**: Some advanced usage scenarios lack documentation.
   - **Status**: Documentation updates planned
   - **Affected**: Advanced usage scenarios

2. **Custom Type Registration Complexity**: Process for registering custom types could be simplified.
   - **Status**: API improvement planned
   - **Affected**: Developer experience
