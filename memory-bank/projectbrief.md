# Project Brief: DataCacheX

## Overview
DataCacheX is a versatile and extensible caching library for Dart and Flutter applications. It provides a flexible and efficient way to store and retrieve data, with support for various storage adapters.

## Core Goals
- Provide a unified interface for data caching across different storage backends
- Support multiple storage adapters (Hive, memory, SQLite, SharedPreferences)
- Enable type-safe data storage and retrieval
- Allow custom expiry settings for cached items
- Implement automatic background cleanup of expired cache items
- Support data serialization for complex types

## Target Audience
- Dart and Flutter developers who need efficient data caching solutions
- Applications requiring offline data persistence
- Projects needing to reduce network requests and improve performance

## Success Criteria
- Simple, intuitive API for caching operations
- Flexibility to switch between storage backends without code changes
- Efficient memory and storage usage
- Proper error handling and recovery
- Comprehensive documentation for developers

## Constraints
- Must be compatible with both Dart and Flutter applications
- Should work efficiently on mobile, web, and desktop platforms
- Must handle type safety properly in a dynamically typed language

## Technical Requirements
- Dart/Flutter compatibility
- Support for various adapters (Hive, SQLite, SharedPreferences, Memory)
- Dependency injection using get_it
- Proper serialization for complex data types
- Background cleanup capabilities
