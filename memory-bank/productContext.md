# Product Context: DataCacheX

## Problem Statement
Mobile and web applications frequently need to cache data to:
- Reduce network requests
- Provide offline functionality
- Improve application performance
- Reduce server load
- Enhance user experience with faster data access

However, implementing caching solutions can be complex, requiring developers to:
- Choose and implement appropriate storage backends
- Handle serialization and deserialization of data
- Manage data expiration and cleanup
- Ensure type safety during storage and retrieval
- Create abstractions for testing and switching backends

## Solution
DataCacheX addresses these challenges by providing:

1. **Unified Interface**: A simple API for caching operations regardless of the storage backend used.

2. **Multiple Storage Options**: Support for various storage adapters:
   - Hive (NoSQL database)
   - Memory (in-memory storage)
   - SQLite (relational database)
   - SharedPreferences (key-value storage)

3. **Type Safety**: Proper handling of different data types with custom serializers.

4. **Expiry Management**: Built-in support for setting expiration times on cached data.

5. **Automatic Cleanup**: Background processes to remove expired cache items.

6. **Extensibility**: Easy addition of custom adapters and serializers.

## User Experience Goals
- **Simple Integration**: Easy to add to any Dart or Flutter project
- **Minimal Configuration**: Sensible defaults with options for customization
- **Intuitive API**: Clear, consistent methods for cache operations
- **Flexibility**: Ability to choose storage backends based on project needs
- **Reliability**: Proper error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Use Cases
