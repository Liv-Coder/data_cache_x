# Code Review for `data_cache_x` Library

This document provides a code review for the `data_cache_x` library, highlighting potential issues, bugs, and areas for improvement.

## `data_cache_x.dart`

- **Lack of documentation for exported members:** While the file has a good library-level comment, it lacks specific documentation for the exported classes, functions, and other members. This makes it harder for users to understand how to use the library.

## `service_locator.dart`

- **Magic numbers:** The `_CacheItemAdapter` uses magic numbers (0 and 1) for field IDs. It would be better to use named constants instead.
