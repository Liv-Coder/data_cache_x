# Code Review for `data_cache_x` Library

This document provides a code review for the `data_cache_x` library, highlighting potential issues, bugs, and areas for improvement.

## `data_cache_x.dart`

- **Lack of documentation for exported members:** While the file has a good library-level comment, it lacks specific documentation for the exported classes, functions, and other members. This makes it harder for users to understand how to use the library.

## `service_locator.dart`

- **Manual type ID assignment:** The `registerAdapter` method uses `_typeIds.length + 100` for default type IDs, which could lead to conflicts if custom type IDs are also used. It would be better to use a more robust approach for generating unique type IDs.
- **Hardcoded default serializers:** The `setupDataCacheX` function registers default serializers for common types. This might not be flexible enough for all use cases. It would be better to allow users to register their own serializers for these types.
- **Potential for adapter conflicts:** The `setupDataCacheX` function registers a singleton instance of each adapter type. If a user tries to register multiple adapters of the same type, it could lead to conflicts.
- **Missing error handling:** The `getAdapter` and `getSerializer` methods throw exceptions if no adapter or serializer is found for a given type. It might be better to return null or use a default implementation instead.
- **Inconsistent encryption handling:** The `enableEncryption` and `encryptionKey` parameters are passed to the adapters, but it's not clear how they are used. It would be better to have a consistent approach for handling encryption across all adapters.
- **Lack of null checks:** There are several places where null checks are missing, which could lead to runtime errors. For example, the `customAdapters` and `customSerializers` parameters are not checked for null before being used.
- **`_CacheItemAdapter` implementation:** The `_CacheItemAdapter` is tightly coupled to the `CacheItem` class and might not be reusable for other types. It would be better to make it more generic.
- **Magic numbers:** The `_CacheItemAdapter` uses magic numbers (0 and 1) for field IDs. It would be better to use named constants instead.
