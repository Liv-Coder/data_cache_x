# Codebase Review of `data_cache_x`

## Suggestions

- **Serialization**: The `serializers` module is currently commented out. Consider implementing a `DataSerializer` to handle custom object serialization.
- **Error Handling**: The `TypeAdapterRegistry` throws a generic `Exception`. Consider creating custom exceptions for better error handling.
- **Configuration**: The `setupDataCacheX` function could be made more configurable, allowing users to register their own adapters and customize the library further.
- **Testing**: Add unit tests for all the core components, including adapters, the `DataCacheX` class, and the `TypeAdapterRegistry`.
- **Documentation**: Add more detailed documentation for each class and function, including usage examples.
- **Background Cleanup**: The `BackgroundCleanup` utility could be made more configurable, allowing users to customize the cleanup process.
- **Encryption**: The `enableEncryption` parameter is present in both `HiveAdapter` and `MemoryAdapter`, but it's not clear how it's being used in `MemoryAdapter`. Clarify the usage or remove it if not needed.
- **Type Safety**: The `_CacheItemAdapter` uses dynamic types. Consider using generics to improve type safety.
- **Code Duplication**: The `_CacheItemAdapter` is duplicated for each type. Consider creating a generic adapter that can handle all types.
- **Extensibility**: Consider making the `TypeAdapterRegistry` more extensible, allowing users to register their own adapters.
- **Performance**: Consider performance implications of using `Hive` for large datasets.
- **Future Updates**:
  - Add support for more storage adapters (e.g., SQLite, shared preferences).
  - Implement a more robust background cleanup mechanism.
  - Add support for caching complex objects.
  - Add support for different cache eviction policies (e.g., LRU, FIFO).
  - Add support for cache invalidation.
  - Add support for cache metrics and monitoring.
